 * @brief outlier removal
 * 
 * The algorithm iterates through the entire input twice:
 * During the first iteration it will compute the average distance that each point
 * has to its nearest k neighbors.
 * The value of k can be set using setMeanK().
 * Next, the mean and standard deviation of all these distances are computed in order
 * to determine a distance threshold.
 * The distance threshold will be equal to: mean + stddev_mult * stddev.
 * The multiplier for the standard deviation can be set using setStddevMulThresh().
 * During the next iteration the points will be classified as inlier or outlier if their
 * average neighbor distance is below or above this threshold respectively.
 * <br>
 * The neighbors found for each query point will be found amongst ALL points of setInputCloud(),
 * not just those indexed by setIndices().
 * The setIndices() method only indexes the points that will be iterated through as search query points.
